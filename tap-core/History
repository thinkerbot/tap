== 0.12.0 / 2008-12-30

As of the 0.12.0 release, Tap is distributed as several independent modules.
This is the core module.  The core classes have been cleaned up significantly
since the 0.11 series, and some changes are not backwards compatible.  The
main task API has been preserved.

Notable changes include:

* Lazydoc is now an independent gem
* Configurable is now an independent gem
* removed use of OptionParser
* Root#directories was refactored to Root#relative_paths
* added several methods to Root
* added splat option for joins
* refactored stack short option to 'k'
* reworked Audit as a directed acyclic graph
* cleanup and extension of FileTask API
