This produces the correct behavior on the command line but is definitely a bad idea.  It would be much better to specify an exit through app, for example, or to return a flag to cease parsing and not run.  Ceasing parsing may require additions to ConfigParser to stop.  \r\n\r\nAlso it may be a good idea to have parser return nil in these cases so that app.parse knows to stop.","at":"3ee11f61b0a93b3701942464b282ebb84deda548","state":"open"}
