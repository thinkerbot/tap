== 0.12.0 / 2008-12-30

As of the 0.12.0 release, Tap is distributed as several independent modules.
This is the test module.  The core classes have been cleaned up significantly
since the 0.11 series, and some changes are not backwards compatible.

Notable changes include:

* Removed RSpec support
* Added Mini::Test support

Upgrade note:

Since Root#directories was refactored to Root#relative_paths in tap-core,
the file_test :directories option needs to be updated to :relative_paths
