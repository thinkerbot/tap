This release removes crufty methods that are rarely used and
add confusion to otherwise focused test modules.

* added indent stripping to ShellTest#assert_output_equal
* added indent stripping to ShellTest#assert_alike

== 0.4.0 / 2009-19-09

Various improvements to the test modules.  Note that FileTest now will
cleanup the method_root directory completely by default; to restore
the old behavior, set cleanup_dirs equal to [:output, :tmp].

* added set_env method to ShellTest
* added indent stripping to sh_test
* changed FileTest to cleanup method_root
  completely by default
