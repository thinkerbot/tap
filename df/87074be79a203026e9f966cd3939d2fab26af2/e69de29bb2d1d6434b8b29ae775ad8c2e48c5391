This makes tests pass but causes templates to go missing when installed as gems. The default templates dir should be the first existing directory for the generator class, ie:\r\n\r\n  app.env.path(:templates, self.class.to_s.underscore) {|dir| File.directory?(dir) }\r\n\r\nBut there also should be some flag to allow dynamic overrides or somesuch where the abstract directory will be queried in full (allowing partial additions/removals).","at":"baa83da1c86412d3d1f42e14b8fb037bfac7a7dc","state":"open"}
