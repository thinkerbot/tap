{"author":" <simon.a.chiang@gmail.com>","title":"Symbolization of configs","tags":["open"],"date":"2009-12-12T20:52:26Z","type":"issue","content":"Yep, it's kind of annoying to have to symbolize configs from a config file.  For example:\r\n\r\n  [tap.yml]\r\n  root:\r\n    :relative_paths:\r\n      :lib: _lib\r\n      :templates: _templates\r\n\r\nThis occurs mainly because in Root you have manual initialization of relative_paths, etc. which do a config.delete(:relative_paths).  There should be something in configurable allowing indifferent access for these cases (which also arise in Env).\r\n\r\n  config.delete(:a) || config.delete('a')\r\n\r\nNote too that by default Env resolves const_paths vs :lib, not 'lib'.  Perhaps it can do both?","at":"4efb87f3d4a23b3d548acd69d8ec52fb94a8da25","state":"open"}
