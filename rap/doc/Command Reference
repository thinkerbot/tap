= Command Reference

Rap comes the rap executable.  For help on the command line, type:

  % rap --help

The rap executable is basically a shorthand for 'tap run --'.  Specifying tasks
for rap is no different than 'tap run' (see the {Syntax Reference}[http://tap.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/doc/Syntax%20Reference.html]).
The only exception occurs when the task  can't be found; unknown tasks are run
as if by rake.  For instance all of these are the same:

Run a rake task with inputs and an ENV config:

  % rake task_name[1,2,3] key=value

Explicitly run a Rap::Rake task using the same inputs:

  % rap rake task_name[1,2,3] key=value

Implicitly run the Rap::Rake task:

  % rap task_name[1,2,3] key=value
