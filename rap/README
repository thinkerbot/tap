= {Rap (Rakish App)}[http://tap.rubyforge.org/rap]

  rap v. a quick, sharp knock or blow
  rakish adj. having a dashing, jaunty, or slightly disreputable quality or appearance

The rakish app extension to {Tap}[http://tap.rubyforge.org].

== Description

{Rake}[http://rake.rubyforge.org/] is great, but it has significant limitations
when used as a general task framework and not as the 'simple ruby build program
with capabilities similar to make' it was originally designed to be.  Rap
supercharges the convenience and familiar syntax of Rake with the capabilities
of Tap, making a configurable, inheritable, and testable amalgam.

=== Limitations

Rap is not a pure replacement of Rake; it does not support builds by default,
and many of the Rake-specific classes (ex FileList) are not included. 

== Usage

Usage is much like rake:

  [Rapfile]
  

Rap does provides its own, documented versions of TestTask, RDocTask, and
GemPackageTask.

== Installation

Rap is available as a gem on RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org/projects/tap].  Use:

  % gem install rap

Rap requires an updated version of RubyGems[http://docs.rubygems.org/] 
(>= 1.2.0).  To check the version and update RubyGems:

  % gem --version
  % gem --update system
