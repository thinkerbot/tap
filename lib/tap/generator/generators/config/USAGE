Description:
    Generates a new config file for a Task.  The configurations, defaults, 
    and documentation is determined from the task.rb file.  Pass the task 
    name, either CamelCased or under_scored.
    
    Versioned config files can be generated as well.  Specify a version by 
    appending the version to the task name.
    
Examples:
    # generates the config file 'config/sample_task'  
    # for SampleTask from 'lib/sample_task.rb'
    % tap generate config SampleTask  
    
    # same, with alternate syntax
    % tap generate config sample_task               
    
    # now with a version, the output config 
    # file is 'config/sample_task-0.1.yml'
    % tap generate config sample_task-0.1
