h1. Installing Tap 

Tap is very easy to install if you already have "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ and "RubyGems":http://www.rubygems.org/ installed on your computer.  See below if you don't, or if you're not sure.  Once you have these prerequisites installed, open a command prompt and use:

pre.. 
  % gem install tap

p. Install dependencies if prompted to do so.

h2. Uninstall

Open a command prompt and use:

pre.. 
  % gem uninstall tap

h1. Installing Ruby and RubyGems

"Ruby":{{ site.links.ruby }} and "RubyGems":{{ site.links.rubygems }} are easy to install on all major operating systems including Mac and Windows.  Many Linux distributions already have Ruby installed by default, as does Mac (although the default Ruby installation on Mac is faulty; Tap requires you reinstall Ruby on Mac).

To test if you have Ruby installed, open a command prompt and type:

pre.. 
  % ruby --version
  ruby 1.8.6 (2007-03-13 patchlevel 0) [i686-darwin8.10.1]

p. The output is for a Mac -- your output will vary if you're not on a Mac.
