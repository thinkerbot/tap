absquatulate - verb: This amusing, vivid, and expressive word is a bit of a jocular, contrived slang.  To absquatulate is to decamp, to scram, to take off in a hell of a hurry like a fugitive heading into the woods.

algorism - noun: This is the name of the Arabic numbering system, using the figures 1 to 9 plus the zero.  The derivation is from Middle Latin algorismus, from the Arabic al (the) plus Khuwarizmi, the surname of a ninth-century Arabic mathematician.  Algorithm is sometimes used as a synonym, but is also used to designate a set of rules for the solution of a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps.  These words are entirely unrelated to algolagnia, with its very different meaning and derivation.

defenestration - verb: Defenestration is the act of throwing someone (yes, someone!) or something out of a window.  To defenestrate a person or thing is to engage in this activity - a strange one indeed, since these words are more commonly applied to situations where what is thrown out of the window is a person, rather than a thing.  It is surprising, in view of what must be the infrequency of this type of activity, that there exists word for it, but then, there exists a word for just about everything.

macaronic - adj: This peculiar word, a jocular concoction from macaroni, is applied, in a narrow sense, to language characterized by a mixture of Latin and non-Latin words, or by non-Latin words given phony Latin endings; in a broader sense, to prose or verse composed of any mixture of languages; in its broadest sense, to anything mixed or jumbled.

trumpery - noun: Trumpery is worthless stuff.  

usufruct - noun: Usufruct is a term used in law primarily, to denote one's right to enjoy the use and benefits flowing from the use of another's property, without the ownership of it and without the right to harm or waste or destroy it.
