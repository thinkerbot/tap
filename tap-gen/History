== 0.7.1 / 2010-05-21

Fixed the permissions of generated files/directories. This is significant
because gems preserve the permissions of packaged files and if, for instance,
a file is distributed in mode 600 then a sudo install will prevent it's use by
the user. (See
http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=126&atid=575&func=detail&aid=3838)
