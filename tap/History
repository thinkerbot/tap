== 0.18.1

  (see tap-tasks:tap/tasks/stream)
  
== 0.18.0 / 2009-06-17

Several updates to simplify Tap.  Most significantly,
dependencies have been removed because their general
utility is quite doubtful, and it it easy to implement
in situations that require them (ex rap).

* bug fix in console (app now refers to Tap::App.instance)
* bug fix in load for recurrently loading from a file
* fixed a mistake in run help
* made load only load once by default, stream loading must
  be enabled in subclasses
* dump now returns the input, not the io
* removed dependencies from tap
* removed intern method on Task (now use app.task)
* removed Support module (ie refactored Templater to
  Tap::Templater)
* removed Task.help method
* added Middleware baseclass
* Task.parse now yields opts to block for modifications
* renamed 'tap/constants' file as 'tap/version'

== 0.17.1 / 2009-06-06

* documentation and interface updates
* reworked load to allow recurrent loads
* modified stack to check_terminate before calling a node
* fixed parsing of empty breaks in command line schema
* simplified/standardized YAML schema syntax
* added support for middleware to parser

== 0.17.0 / 2009-05-25

Significant reorganization and update to Tap internals.
The workflow syntax for joins has changed in incompatible
ways, and several key methods have been renamed.  
Obviously not backwards compatible but most tasks will
work without alteration.

Upgrade Notes:

* Tasks now are identified by "::task" rather than "::manifest"
  The manifest identifier still works for now but will be
  removed by 1.0.
* Root#filepath and Root#relative_filepath have been renamed
  Root#path and Root#relative_path
* Audits have been removed
* Generators, FileTask, and test modules have been removed
  to separate modules (tap-gen, tap-tasks, tap-test). Install
  tap-suite to get them all back.
* switched const_name, name on Constant
* refactored on_complete_block to join
* callbacks in Task have been removed
* schema syntax no longer supports rounds, globals

Changes:

* added application middleware
* reworked dump to use an io target config
* added unloading to Constant
* reworked App to use aggregators that respond_to? call
* reworked Join so that it may be dumped as YAML
* reworked Schema syntax
* etc

== 0.12.4 / 2009-03-23

* fixed bug in App#inspect
* documentation updates
* changed the default load/dump configs to load and
  dump data without serialization
* made stdin the default input to load
* updated run syntax to allow arguments to be passed
  to saved workflows
* updates to RootGenerator

== 0.12.3 / 2009-03-05

* Updates to allow Tap to use the latest Configurable.
* Updated RootGenerator
* Fixed minor task --help bugs
* Documentation updates

== 0.12.2 / 2009-02-23

* Added --no-yaml option to Dump and Load
* Added --aggregate option to Join
* Updated Dump behavior to merge inputs before process
* Reworked App so that it is not a Root
* Added the ability to load workflows via 'tap run'

== 0.12.1 / 2009-02-18

Maintenance release with updates to Dump and Load tasks.

* refactored Dump as CoreDump
* implemented a simple yaml Dump
* simplified Load

== 0.12.0 / 2009-02-17

As of the 0.12.0 release, Tap is distributed as several independent modules
which can be collectively installed through tap-suite.  Tap has been cleaned
up significantly since the 0.11 series, and some changes are not backwards
compatible.  The main task API has been preserved.

Notable changes include:

* Lazydoc, Configurable, Rap, and Tap generators are now
  independent gems.  Install the whole suite via tap-suite
* Removed use of OptionParser
* Root#directories was refactored to Root#relative_paths
* Added several methods to Root
* Added splat option for joins
* Refactored stack short option to 'k'
* Reworked Sequence, Fork, and Merge as special cases of Join
* Reworked Audit as a directed acyclic graph
* Cleanup and extension of FileTask API
* Removed RSpec support
* Added Mini::Test support
* Added/clarified Task nesting
* Removed batching from Executable (neat feature but complex in joins)
* The tap executable longer automatically reconfigures tasks from config files

Upgrade note:

* Root#directories was refactored to Root#relative_path, so the file_test
  :directories option needs to be updated to :relative_paths
* Several test methods were removed in favor of better alternatives through
  method_root itself.  In particular method_tempfile('path') should be
  replaced with method_root.prepare(:tmp, 'path').
* EnvVars#env was refactored to EnvVars#env_var to prevent a common collision
  with env as a test variable.

== 0.11.0 / 2008-10-20

Significant update to Tap with many internal reworks.
Major changes include:

* Addition of Parser/Schema
* Addition of rap and task declarations
* Removal of Workflow in preference of workflow
  definitions within Task
* Refactoring of Test modules
* Expanded/updated documentation

== 0.10.1 / 2008-08-21

Update of Tap with a few improvements to manifests
and a new manifest command.

* Fixed some bugs and extended manifests
* Bug fixes in generators
* Added task definitions to Workflow

== 0.10.0 / 2008-08-08

Major revision.  Reworked configurations and the execution
environment.  Added Lazydoc documentation.  Backwards incompatible.
Development is now on GitHub. 

== 0.9.1 / 2008-04-26 revision 253

Relatively minor update, but with one important refactoring that
removes the Tap::Script module.  This breaks backward compatibility
but only should affect people who have made their own commands.
Simply sub Tap::Support::CommandLine for Tap::Script to fix.

* Added constants methods (ex try_constantize) to String
* Added gem discovery when no tap.yml file is present
* Cleanup and refactoring -- removal of Tap::Script
* Bug fix for JRuby 1.1.1

== 0.9.0 / 2008-04-09 revision 246

Major update to Tap. Many changes in this release ARE NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  

* Reworked Task and App such that methods,  are
  enqued and executed.  Made the Executable module 
  to allow any Method to be enqued and executed.
* App now aggregates results for methods that have no 
  on_complete block; enabled access through App#results 
  and App#_results.
* Removed iteration from tasks
* Task no longer templates app.config_templates.  Templating code
  removed from this distribution.
* Work to improve audit usability and visualization
* Removed methods forwarding from Audit to Audit#_current,
  as well as ambiguous Audit methods
* Root [] now returns expanded paths unchanged. Example:
  app['relative/path']  # => File.join(app.root, 'relative/path')
  app['/expanded/path'] # => '/expanded/path'
* Generalized rake support; now supports version 0.8.1
* Fixes in generators
* Improvements in running of multithread tasks
* Removed condition blocks from tasks
* many other things also...
