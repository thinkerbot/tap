Relatively minor update, but with one important refactoring that
removes the Tap::Script module.  This breaks backward compatibility
but only should affect people who have made their own commands.
Simply sub Tap::Support::CommandLine for Tap::Script to fix.

* Added gem discovery when no tap.yml file is present
* Cleanup and refactoring -- removal of Tap::Script
* Bug fix for JRuby 1.1.1

Major update to Tap. Many changes in this release ARE NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  

* Reworked Task and App such that methods,  are
  enqued and executed.  Made the Executable module 
  to allow any Method to be enqued and executed.

  on_complete block; enabled access through App#results 
  and App#_results.
* Removed iteration from tasks
* Task no longer templates app.config_templates.  Templating code
  removed from this distribution.
* Work to improve audit usability and visualization
* Removed methods forwarding from Audit to Audit#_current,
  as well as ambiguous Audit methods

  app['relative/path']  # => File.join(app.root, 'relative/path')
  app['/expanded/path'] # => '/expanded/path'
* Generalized rake support; now supports version 0.8.1
* Fixes in generators
* Improvements in running of multithread tasks
* Removed condition blocks from tasks
