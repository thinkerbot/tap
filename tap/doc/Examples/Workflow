= Workflow Examples

=== Sequence

A simple sequence using the --: syntax that joins the previous to next task.

  % tap run -- load 'goodnight moon' --: dump
  goodnight moon
  
=== Sequence (canonical)

The more canonical way of specifying a sequence.

  % tap run -- load 'goodnight moon' -- dump --[0][1]
  goodnight moon

=== Fork

Multiple outputs for a single input.

  % tap run -- load 'goodnight moon' -- dump -- dump --[0][1,2]
  goodnight moon
  goodnight moon
  
=== Merge

Multiple inputs for a single output; note that as seen in the output, dump
receives the inputs in serial, whenever they happen to be ready.

  % tap run -- load goodnight -- load moon -- dump --[0,1][2]
  goodnight
  moon

=== Synchronized Merge

Similar to a merge, but the results of each input are collected into an array
before being passed to dump. The printout is: ['goodnight', 'moon'].to_s

  % tap run -- load goodnight -- load moon -- dump --[0,1][2].sync
  goodnightmoon
  
=== Multiple Rounds

Normally tasks are enqued in the order they appear. Tasks can be enqued into
multiple rounds of execution by adding '+' signs to a break. Here the
goodnight load task will run after the first round, and the other load tasks,
run to completion.

  % tap run -- load hello --+ load goodnight -- load moon -- dump --[0,1,2][3]
  hello
  moon
  goodnight
