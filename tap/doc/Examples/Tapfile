= Tapfile

Tapfiles can be used to define tasks and workflows, typically using the
Tap::Declarations syntax which is reminiscent of the Rake syntax.

  [tapfile]
  require 'tap/declarations'
  

A task declaration:

  task(<name>, <arg_names...>, {<configs>}) do |task, args|
    # arguments are available through args:
    args.arg_name
    
    # configurations are available through task
    task.key
  end

A task declaration with dependencies:

  task({<name> => [<dependencies...>]}, <arg_names...>, {<configs>}) { task ... }

A namespace declaration:

  namespace(<name>) { task ... }
 
Simple documentation:
 
  desc "description"
  task ...
  
Extended documentation:
  
  # :: description
  # Extended documentation may span multiple lines, and 
  # supports
  #
  #   code indentation
  #   like this.
  #
  # Lines are justified and wrapped on the command line.
  task ...
