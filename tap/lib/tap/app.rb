  # App coordinates the setup and execution of workflows.
  #
  # === Workflows
  #
  # Workflows are composed of nodes and joins such as instances of Tap::Task
  # and Tap::Join.  The actual workflow exists between nodes; each node can
  # specify a join to receive it's output and enque or execute other nodes.
  # When a node does not have a join, apps allow the specification of a
  # default join to, for instance, aggregate results.
  #
  # Any object satisfying the correct API[link:files/doc/API.html] can be used
  # as a node or join.  Apps have helpers to make nodes out of blocks.
  #
  #   app = Tap::App.new
  #   n = app.node {|*inputs| inputs }
  #   app.enq(n, 'a', 'b', 'c')
  #   app.enq(n, 1)
  #   app.enq(n, 2)
  #   app.enq(n, 3)
  #
  #   results = []
  #   app.on_complete {|result| results << result }
  #
  #   app.run
  #   results                        # => [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1], [2], [3]]
  #
  # To construct a workflow, set joins for individual nodes.  Here is a simple
  # sequence:
  #
  #   n0 = app.node { "a" }
  #   n1 = app.node {|input| "#{input}.b" }
  #   n2 = app.node {|input| "#{input}.c"}
  #
  #   n0.on_complete {|result| app.execute(n1, result) }
  #   n1.on_complete {|result| app.execute(n2, result) }
  #   app.enq(n0)
  #
  #   results.clear
  #   app.run
  #   results                        # => ["a.b.c"]
  #
  # Tasks have helpers to simplify the manual constructon of workflows, but
  # even with these methods large workflows are cumbersome to build.  More
  # typically, a Tap::Schema is used in such cases.
  #
  # === Middleware
  #
  # Apps allow middleware to wrap the execution of each node.  This can be
  # particularly useful to track the progress of a workflow.  Middleware is
  # initialized with the application stack and uses the call method to
  # wrap the execution of the stack.
  #
  # Using middleware, an auditor looks like this:
  #
  #   class AuditMiddleware
  #     attr_reader :stack, :audit
  #
  #     def initialize(stack)
  #       @stack = stack
  #       @audit = []
  #     end
  #
  #     def call(node, inputs=[])
  #       audit << node
  #       stack.call(node, inputs)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   auditor = app.use AuditMiddleware
  #
  #   app.enq(n0)
  #   app.enq(n2, "x")
  #   app.enq(n1, "y")
  #
  #   results.clear
  #   app.run
  #   results                        # => ["a.b.c", "x.c", "y.b.c"]
  #   auditor.audit                  
  #   # => [
  #   # n0, n1, n2, 
  #   # n2,
  #   # n1, n2
  #   # ]
  # 
  # Middleware can be nested with multiple calls to use.
  #
  class App
    class << self
      # Sets the current app instance
      attr_writer :instance
      
      # Returns the current instance of App.  If no instance has been set,
      # then instance initializes a new App with the default configuration.

    #
    # The default_joins for self will be called if node.joins returns

    #                    running node will be discontinued as described in
    #                    terminate.
