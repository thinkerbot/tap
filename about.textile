h1. Acknowledgements

A great deal of inspiration came from other excellent open-source projects including "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org and "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org. 

Thanks to my advisor "Dr. Kirk Hansen":http://hsc-proteomics.uchsc.edu/hansenlab/ for his patience in letting me work on this project, and for putting together an awesome lab.

Most of all I would like to *thank my family* for their never-ending support.

h2. Code

Tap uses ActiveSupport for dependencies loading and a variety of other extensions.  Tap uses Rails generators and redistributes the code in the gem, to avoid an additional dependency.
