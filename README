= Tap (Task Application)

A framework for creating configurable, distributable, and easy-to-use tasks and workflow applications.

See the {website}[http://tap.rubyforge.org] for more information.

== Description

Tap provides a framework to define, configure, and join tasks into workflows. Tap provides a lot of niceties like generators and libraries geared towards testing tasks, generating documentation, as well as task execution and distribution.  Tasks are immediately available from the command line through the 'tap' command.

Make a task:

  % tap generate task sample/task

Run the task setting the 'key' configuration:
  
  % tap run -- sample/task --key=value input
  ctl-i prints information
  ctl-c interupts execution
  beginning run...
    I[10:53:11]        sample/task input was processed with value
  
Interact with the task using irb:

  % tap console
  irb(main):001:0> t = app.task('sample/task', :key => 'value')
  irb(main):002:0> t.enq('input')
  irb(main):003:0> app.run
    I[10:55:17]        sample/task input was processed with value

Additional Notes:

- Tap can incorporate and run Rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org/] tasks as well as Tap tasks. 
- Tap task libraries are designed for distribution as gems.  
- Tap is tested on both MRI (the standard Ruby interpreter, versions 1.8.6 and 1.9.0) and JRuby[http://jruby.codehaus.org/].  

=== Bugs/Known Issues

- Some inconsequential tests on JRuby fail due to bugs in JRuby itself.
- Several patches are required so that Tap runs properly on MRI 1.9.0.  These   
  will likely resolve themselves as 1.9.0 becomes stable.
- Some code is still in progress; in general the well-documented code is stable.

== Installation

Tap is available as a gem on RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org/projects/tap].  Use:

  % gem install tap

See the tutorial or check out the {website}[http://tap.rubyforge.org] to get started using Tap programatically.

== Credits

A great deal of inspiration came from other excellent open-source projects including Rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org] and {Ruby on Rails}[http://www.rubyonrails.org].  

Thanks to my advisor {Dr. Kirk Hansen}[http://hsc-proteomics.uchsc.edu/hansenlab/] for his patience in letting me work on this project, and for putting together an awesome lab.

Most of all I would like to <b>thank my family</b> for their never-ending support.

=== Code

Tap uses ActiveSupport for dependencies loading and a variety of other extensions.  Tap uses Rails generators and redistributes the code in the gem, to avoid an additional dependency.
